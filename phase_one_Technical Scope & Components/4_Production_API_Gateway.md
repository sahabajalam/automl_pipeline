4. Production API Gateway (Deployment Foundation)


**Purpose**: RESTful interface enabling cloud deployment and integration

**Core Capabilities**:

- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking job submission with progress tracking
- **Multi-Format Support**: CSV, JSON, Excel upload with automatic format detection
- **Real-Time Inference**: Trained model serving with input validation
- **Job Management**: Status tracking, result retrieval, and error reporting
- **API Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI specification with testing interface

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **FastAPI Framework**: High-performance async API with automatic validation
- **Background Tasks**: Celery integration for long-running training jobs
- **File Management**: Secure upload handling with size limits and validation
- **Response Caching**: Redis integration for frequently accessed results

**Week 4 Deliverables**:

- Complete FastAPI implementation with all endpoint functionality
