5. Basic MLOps Integration

**Purpose**: Experiment tracking and model lifecycle management

**Core Capabilities**:

- **Experiment Logging**: MLflow integration with automatic run tracking
- **Model Registry**: Version management with metadata and performance storage
- **Artifact Management**: Model and pipeline serialization with retrieval capabilities
- **Performance Comparison**: Model comparison interface with metric visualization
- **Deployment Tracking**: Model deployment history and rollback capabilities

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **MLflow Integration**: Streamlined logging with minimal configuration overhead
- **Automated Registration**: Model registration triggered by performance thresholds
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Automatic capture of training context and hyperparameters
- **Simple UI**: MLflow UI for experiment browsing and model comparison

**Success Criteria**:

- Tracks all experiments with complete reproducibility information
- Enables model comparison and selection through UI
- Maintains model lineage and performance history
- Supports easy model retrieval and deployment
