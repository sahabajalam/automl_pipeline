2. Feature Engineering Pipeline (Classical ML Foundation)

**Purpose**: Intelligent preprocessing and feature creation with minimal manual intervention

**Core Capabilities**:

- **Smart Preprocessing**: Context-aware missing value handling and categorical encoding
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatic selection of scaling strategies based on data distribution
- **Feature Generation**: Basic polynomial features and interaction terms for performance improvement
- **Validation Framework**: Automated feature quality assessment and leakage detection
- **Pipeline Persistence**: Serializable preprocessing pipelines for consistent inference

**Implementation Strategy**:

- **Scikit-learn Foundation**: Modular pipeline architecture with custom transformers
- **LLM-Guided Strategies**: GenAI recommendations for preprocessing approach selection
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation preventing common feature engineering mistakes
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based pipeline configuration for reproducibility

**Week 2 Deliverables**:

- Complete feature engineering pipeline with automated strategy selection
- LLM-guided preprocessing recommendations integrated into workflow
- Feature validation framework preventing data leakage and quality issues
- Pipeline serialization and configuration management system
